<h2>Who we are</h2>
<h3>At Safe Haven, we are family. We will thrive together as a house of prayer, devotion, worship, and a house where revelation from God and His Word are not only preached but lived.
    There is a mandate from Heaven to help cultivate and grow the body of Christ, teaching them how to be followers of Christ through developing an intimate relationship with Him.
    We are committed to equipping people in navigating life with God and to secure Heaven as their eternal home.
    We are excited to walk out this mission of loving and serving people with you!</h3>
